# MJS.ART Novation Repo
I create tons of templates for myself, and I think others would find them useful, too. So I'm sharing them with the community.

This repo is dedicated to the Novation - https://novationmusic.com/ - family of products.

## Launchpad Pro MK3
I wanted a template for creating Launchpad Pro MK3 'cheat sheets' and I couldn't find what I was looking for online, so I created one. I tried to make it as accurate as possible, and while it might not be CAD-accurate, it's close enough for me. YMMV.

I used "Avenir Next Medium" as the font, and converted all of the text to outlines so you don't need the font on your system.

### About The Files
I've grouped buttons and labels in separate layers to make it easy to turn the labels on/off for printing, if you want/need to do that.
